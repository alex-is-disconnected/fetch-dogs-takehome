## Fetch Frontend Engineer Takehome

#### By Alex Vinicius Silva

This is my submission for the Frontend Engineer takehome assessment at Fetch!

Built in React + Typescript, bundled with Vite, and hosted on Vercel.

To run the site locally use:

`npm run dev`

All of the requested features in the requirements should be fully implemented.
